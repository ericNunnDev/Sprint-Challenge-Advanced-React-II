- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

-- When working with legacy code. That is the only situation I can see, as hooks makes the code much more readable and manageable.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

-- componentDidMount: Is where we load our data.

-- render: Returns the JSX of the component.

-- componentWillUnmount: Cancel any outgoing requests, remove event listeners, component clean up.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

-- To allow developers to extract logic into reusable functions.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

-- Testing acts as a safety net during development. It makes the code much more readable, makes adding features and refactoring code easier, and catches bugs faster.
